# **AVA-Dialogues**
## **Dataset with dialogues for AVA to behave like JARVIS from Iron Man**
A dataset customized for training purposes to strictly behave like JARVIS created by Tony Stark. This is strictly conversational data so that the personally built LLM can use the same langauge pattern as that of JARVIS. It's strictly formal.

I will add more datasets here so that a JARVIS like LLM can respond to any or all of the user queries with that butler-like attitude. 

You can opt to customize the dataset yourself in order to change the name of the wake word which in this case would be AVA, and to address you according to your desired pronoun.

There will be more datasets regarding other behaviors apart from text synthesis.
