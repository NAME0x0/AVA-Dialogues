# **AVA**

## **AVA**
*Defining AVA:*

AVA is a personal LLM project of mine from which I intend to learn more about python, AI in general, and GitHub itself too. I have always wanted to have an AI assistant that could do everything like JARVIS and this is my take on it. AVA has capabilities of a generic assistant right now, however, that's not enough. Hence, I am making a personalized Language Model which helps me get closer to my goal of making my very own AI.

## **Python personal assistant script**
I have uploaded the scripts for my generic python-based personal assistant scripts. AVA currently has a CLI; work will be done to implement a GUI. To access AVA, either click on the .py file or navigate to the directory where you save AVA.py and use the cd command to navigate to that directory path and type *python AVA.py* to access AVA. I will add a .txt file too which has all the libraries required to access AVA. It is recommended to use *venv* to save all the libraries in that specific directory but should work perfectly fine even without it.

## **Datasets for training AVA to behave like JARVIS from Iron Man**
A dataset customized for training purposes to strictly behave like JARVIS created by Tony Stark. This is strictly conversational data so that the personally built LLM can use the same langauge pattern as that of JARVIS. It's strictly formal.

I will add more datasets here so that a JARVIS like LLM can respond to any or all of the user queries with that butler-like attitude. 

You can opt to customize the dataset yourself in order to change the name of the wake word which in this case would be AVA, and to address you according to your desired pronoun.

There will be more datasets regarding other behaviors apart from text synthesis.
